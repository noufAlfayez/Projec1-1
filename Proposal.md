# Saudi-Stock-Market-Data-Analysis-Tadawul-

<h3> Problem Statement and Questions : </h3> <br>
Using data science in the stock market is not new, but that doesn't apply for Saudi Stock Exchange (Tadawul), It needs to be explored and studied deeply.
This project aims to analyze the Saudi Stock Market (Tadawul) data, as it answers some questions related to the data, such as: What is the day that achieves the highest trades?
What companies have the highest stock price? What companies have the lowest stock price?
Then I will build a model that predicts stock closing prices, I implement this project to pass the T5 Data Scientist Bootcamp.
